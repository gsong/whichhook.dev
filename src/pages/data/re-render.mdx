# Re-Render When Data Changes

Do you have properties that are separate but related? A good example
would be tracking fetch status, result, and error.

- <Link to="hooks/useReducer">
    Yes, there are separate but related properties I need to change at the same
    time.
  </Link>

    For example, upon successful fetch, I want to change the `status` to `done`
    and `result` to the response object.
- <Link to="hooks/useState">
    No, I'm just tracking a simple, single, isolated value.
  </Link>
